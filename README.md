# music-genre-classification
Machine learning project dealing with classification of music files into music genres. Several different machine learning algorithms are currently implemented, namely k-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks. The latter can be applied to melspectrograms of the music files as well as in a transfer learning setting.

 The configuration **train_nn_vgg.json** and features extracted by Google's [VGGish](https://tfhub.dev/google/vggish/1) yielded an accuracy of 64.7% at [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tsma-202021-music-genre-classification/overview) kaggle challenge.
