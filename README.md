# music-genre-classification
Machine learning project dealing with classification of music files into music genres. Several different machine learning algorithms have been implemented, namely k-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks. The latter was applied to melspectrograms of the music files as well as in a transfer learning setting.

 The best results were obtained with the configuration *train_nn_vgg.json*.
